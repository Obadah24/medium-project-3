### in brief about the medium project about React Budget Allocation App with Context API and Bootstrap Grid System.

# AppContext.js

- This code is defining a React context and provider for managing a budgeting app. It starts by importing necessary dependencies such as React and useReducer. Then, it defines a reducer function that updates the state based on different actions such as adding or reducing expenses, setting the budget, or changing the currency.

- The initial state of the app includes a budget of 20000, and a list of expenses with their names and costs. The context is created using createContext(), and the provider component is defined to wrap the components that need access to the state.

- The provider component uses useReducer() to set up the app state with the reducer function and initial state. It also calculates the remaining budget after subtracting all expenses from the total budget.

- Finally, the code exports the context and provider for use in other components.

# App.js

This code defines the main App component for a budget allocation app. It imports several components such as Budget, Remaining, ExpenseTotal, ExpenseList, Currency, and AllocationForm from their respective files. It also imports the AppProvider context from './context/AppContext'.

The App component returns a JSX expression that wraps all the imported components inside an AppProvider component. The AppProvider component provides the app state to all the child components using React context.

The JSX expression is structured using Bootstrap's grid system to display the components in a responsive layout. The Budget, Remaining, and ExpenseTotal components are displayed in a row, while the Currency component is displayed in a separate column.

The ExpenseList component is displayed in a separate row below the header 'Allocation'. Similarly, the AllocationForm component is displayed in a separate row below the header 'Change allocation'.

Finally, the App component is exported as the default export of the file for use in other parts of the app.
